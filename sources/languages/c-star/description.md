According to [Wikipedia][1], C* is a language that was originally designed as an
alternative to [*Lisp][3] and [CM-FORTRAN][4]. Beyond that, there's really not much
documentation.

That said, I did manage to dig up [the user guide for C*][2] if you want to play
around with that. If you have any additional documentation, let me know.
