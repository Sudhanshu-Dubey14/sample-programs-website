title: The C\* Programming Language
---

Welcome to the C\* page! Here, you'll find a description of the language as well as a list of sample programs in that language.

## Description

According to [Wikipedia][1], C* is a language that was originally designed as an
alternative to [*Lisp][3] and [CM-FORTRAN][4]. Beyond that, there's really not much
documentation.

That said, I did manage to dig up [the user guide for C*][2] if you want to play
around with that. If you have any additional documentation, let me know.
