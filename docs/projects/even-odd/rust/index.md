title: Even Odd in Rust
---

Welcome to the [Even Odd](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/even-odd) in [Rust](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/rust) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```rust
// Requirement is in https://sample-programs.therenegadecoder.com/projects/even-odd/
// Program to accept an integer on the command line and outputs if the integer is Even or Odd.

use std::env::args;
use std::process::exit;
use std::str::FromStr;

fn usage() -> ! {
    println!("Usage: please input a number");
    exit(0);
}

fn parse_int<T: FromStr>(s: &str) -> Result<T, <T as FromStr>::Err> {
    s.trim().parse::<T>()
}

fn main() {
    let mut args = args().skip(1);

    // Exit if 1st command-line argument not an integer
    let mut input_num: i32 = args
        .next()
        .and_then(|s| parse_int(&s).ok())
        .unwrap_or_else(|| usage());

    // Even if divisible by 2, Odd otherwise
    match input_num % 2 == 0 {
        true => println!("Even"),
        false => println!("Odd"),
    }
}

```

{% endraw %}
