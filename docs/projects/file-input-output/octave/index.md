title: File Input Output in Octave
---

Welcome to the [File Input Output](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/file-input-output) in [Octave](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/octave) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```octave
path = "output.txt";

% Write content to file
file = fopen(path,'w');
if file == -1
    fprintf(strcat(path, " does not exist\n"));
    return;
end
fprintf(file, "Hello, World!\n");
fprintf(file, "Goodbye!\n");
fclose(file);

% Read content from file
file = fopen(path,'r');
if file == -1
    fprintf(strcat(path, " does not exist\n"));
    return;
end
a = fgetl(file);
while ischar(a)
    disp(a);
    a = fgetl(file);
end
fclose(file);

```

{% endraw %}
