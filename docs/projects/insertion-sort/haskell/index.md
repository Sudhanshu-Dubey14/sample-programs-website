Welcome to the [Insertion Sort](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/insertion-sort) in [Haskell](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/haskell) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```haskell
module Main where

import Text.Read
import System.Environment
import System.Exit (exitWith, ExitCode(ExitFailure))
import Data.List (intercalate)


insertion :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
insertion = go []
  where go sorted []     = sorted
        go sorted (x:xs) = go (insert x sorted) xs


insert :: Ord a => a -> [a] -> [a]
insert a [] = [a]
insert a (x:xs)
  | a > x     = x:insert a xs
  | otherwise = a:x:xs


headMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
headMaybe []     = Nothing
headMaybe (x:xs) = Just x

-- Converts string in format "1, 2, 3" to a Maybe list of int
stringToListMaybe :: String -> Maybe [Int]
stringToListMaybe str = readMaybe $ "[" ++ str ++ "]" :: Maybe [Int]

-- Ensure that a list contains at least two elements
verifyListLength :: Ord a => [a] -> Maybe [a]
verifyListLength []     = Nothing
verifyListLength [x]    = Nothing
verifyListLength (x:xs) = Just (x:xs)

listToString :: [Int] -> String
listToString = intercalate ", " . map show


main :: IO ()
main = do
  args <- getArgs
  let xs = headMaybe args >>= stringToListMaybe >>= verifyListLength
  case xs of
    Nothing -> do
      putStrLn "Usage: please provide a list of at least two integers to sort in the format \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\""
      exitWith $ ExitFailure 1
    Just xs  -> putStrLn $ listToString $ insertion xs


```
