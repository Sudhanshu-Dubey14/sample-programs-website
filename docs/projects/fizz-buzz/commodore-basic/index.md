Welcome to the [Fizz Buzz](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/fizz-buzz) in [Commodore Basic](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/commodore-basic) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```commodore_basic
10 FOR I = 1 TO 100
20     S$ = ""
30     IF (I - INT(I / 3) * 3) = 0 THEN S$ = S$ + "Fizz"
40     IF (I - INT(I / 5) * 5) = 0 THEN S$ = S$ + "Buzz"
45     REM STR$(I) prepends a space for positive numbers. MID$ removes it
50     IF S$ = "" THEN S$ = S$ + MID$(STR$(I), 2)
60     PRINT S$
70 NEXT I

```

{% endraw %}
