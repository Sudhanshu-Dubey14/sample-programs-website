Welcome to the [Fibonacci](https://sampleprograms.io/projects/fibonacci) in [Julia](https://sampleprograms.io/languages/julia) page! Here, you'll find the source code for this program as well as a description of how the program works.

## Current Solution

{% raw %}

```julia
#!/usr/bin/julia

function fib(n)
    f = BigInt[1 1; 1 0]
    for i = 1:n
        fn = f ^ i
        println(i, ": ", fn[2, 1])
    end
end

function error() 
   println("Usage: please input the count of fibonacci numbers to output") 
end

try
    fib(parse(Int, ARGS[1]))
catch e
    error()
end


```

{% endraw %}
